    ### API versions

    :::caution
    We highly recommend using versioning in your API calls. If you don't provide a version header on the operations where it's required, you will receive an error response.
    :::

    The Merchant API uses request header versioning. Where it is required you need to use the `Revolut-Api-Version` header parameter to specify an API version. Each request, where it is indicated in the API specification, must contain a version header in the following format:
      
    ```
    'Revolut-Api-Version: 2025-10-16'
    ```

      The Orders resource in the Merchant API offers a comprehensive solution for managing the lifecycle of orders within your e-commerce or retail platform. Designed to streamline order processing, this resource encapsulates a suite of operations that allow for efficiently handling order management-related tasks. For more information about the order lifecycle, see: [Order and payment lifecycle](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/other-resources/order-payment-flow).

      These operations are equipped to handle various order management scenarios, providing a robust interface for businesses to interact with their order data. 

      To process a payment related to your customers' purchases, you need to create an `Order` object. Then you can use an order's unique `token` to process and accept payments via the Revolut Checkout Widget.

      :::caution
      The [Create an order endpoint](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-order) was updated to a new version and now returns `token` as the public identifier for the order. Previous integrations might still use the deprecated endpoint returning `public_id`.

      We strongly advise upgrading to the new [Create an order endpoint](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-order).
      :::
  - name: Customers
    description: |-
      The Customers resource in the Merchant API is a pivotal tool for tracking and managing customer-related transactions within your e-commerce or retail platform. This resource provides a structured approach to customer management, enabling you to maintain a consistent record of customer transactions.

      A `Customer` object can be created using the [Create a customer](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-customer) endpoint and you can then retrieve, update and delete a customer using its `id`. `Customer` objects enable you to track multiple transactions in your system associated with the same customer in the Merchant API.

      You can save and store payment methods of a customer in the `payment_method` object, for more information, see: [Charge a customer's saved payment method](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/save-and-charge-payment-methods/charge-saved-payment-method). A merchant can store the details of the payment securely and group transactions from the same payment method in their system. 

      A payment method is unique for each customer. For example, if the same card is used for a transaction by two different customers, two payment method objects are created linked to each customer.

      Similar principle applies when saving payment methods via Revolut Pay for merchant initiated transaction (MIT - useful for recurring payments). If a customer saves their details through Revolut Pay for MIT in separate sessions, each session will create a new payment method object linked to the customer.

      :::note
      You cannot create a payment method explicitly because they are generated as part of a payment. You can only retrieve, update or delete a payment method, or you can retrieve all payment methods of a customer.

      :::
  - name: Subscriptions
    description: |-
      The Subscriptions API provides a complete solution for creating and managing recurring billing for your customers.

      You can automatically charge customers on flexible billing cycles, manage sophisticated subscription plans, and track the entire billing history for every subscriber.

      ## How it works?

      A subscription's billing structure is defined by a **Subscription plan**. This model gives you granular control:

      - **Plans** contain one or more **variations** (e.g., a "Gold" plan could have "Monthly" and "Yearly" variations).
      - **Variations** can have multiple **phases** (e.g., a 7-day free trial followed by a regular billing phase).

      This powerful structure allows you to build complex pricing models, including free trials, introductory offers, and tiered pricing.

      ## Key features

      - **Flexible pricing models:** Create plans with multiple variations and phases to support any billing scenario.
      - **Automated charging:** Automatically charge a customer's saved payment method at the start of each billing cycle.
      - **Hosted onboarding:** For new customers, generate a setup order with a redirect URL to Revolut's Hosted Payment Page, allowing them to securely add a payment method.
      - **Lifecycle tracking:** Monitor each billing cycle's state, view all associated orders, and access complete payment histories.
      - **Full subscription management:** Easily update customer payment methods, cancel subscriptions, and view a complete billing history.
  - name: Payouts
    description: |-
      Endpoints for retrieving information about payouts, allowing merchants to access details of funds withdrawn from their Merchant account to external bank accounts.

      Merchants can use these endpoints to retrieve a list of payouts and specific payout details. The payout IDs obtained can be used to [generate detailed reports](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/report-runs) that provide comprehensive breakdowns of all transactions contributing to the payout amounts.

      Payout information, including IDs, can be retrieved via the [Retrieve payout list](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/retrieve-payout-list) endpoint or from [webhook events related to payouts](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-webhook#callbacks).
  - name: Disputes
    description: |-
      Endpoints that allow merchants to view customer payment disputes. 

       It provides a robust framework with high-level states (e.g., `won`, `lost`, `needs_response`, `under_review`) and detailed substates (e.g., `lost_expired`, `pre_arbitration`, `won_pre_arbitration`, etc.) to accurately track the dispute lifecycle. 
       
       Additionally, the API integrates standard dispute reason codes and human-readable descriptions, offering a customisable approach to dispute resolution that facilitates effective dispute management.
  - name: Report runs
    description: |-
      In addition to the CSV statements you can export via the [Revolut Business Dashboard](https://business.revolut.com/merchant/statement), you can generate custom CSV reports using the **Report runs** operations. Unlike the default statements, creating custom reports offers you more flexibility in determining what data you wish to incorporate. This allows you to have more control over your analytics.

      For more information about how to generate custom CSV reports, see: [Create CSV reports of transactions](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/create-csv-reports).
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |-
      A `webhook` (also called a web callback) allows your system to receive an event from a different app immediately after it happens. 

      For example, you can subscribe to a webhook when an order changes from `pending` to `completed` status. When the payment is cleared and the order is completed, Revolut servers send a notification to the URL of your choice. This is a more efficient way to know when an order is paid as opposed to trying to get the status of the order every few seconds.

      Many events that happen to a Revolut Merchant account are synchronous, which means they arrive instantly and have immediate results. For example, a successful request to create a customer immediately returns a `Customer` object. Such requests don't require webhooks.

      The Revolut Merchant API supports webhooks for events including `ORDER_COMPLETED` and `ORDER_AUTHORISED`.

      :::note
      Because we cannot guarantee the delivery order of the status (`events`), you might receive the status not in the expected order. Make sure that your implementation does not rely on the order that the events are being received in.
      :::

      For example, for a completed order, you should receive the `ORDER_AUTHORISED` status first and then `ORDER_COMPLETED`. However, if the `ORDER_AUTHORISED` status isn't sent successfully at first, it's moved to the queue to be resent in the next few minutes. Before then, if the `ORDER_COMPLETED` status is sent successfully, you get `ORDER_COMPLETED` first and then `ORDER_AUTHORISED`.

      Check out our tutorial for [Using webhooks to keep track of the payment lifecycle](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/work-with-webhooks/using-webhooks).

      :::
  - name: Locations
    description: |-
      The Locations API is designed to help merchants manage multiple points of sale, including both **online storefronts** and **physical stores**. Registering locations lets you differentiate and group your orders from different stores. You can also introduce custom business logic for each location, such as different inventory management, pricing, or shipping rules.

      To start using locations, follow the relevant use case for your business:

      ### Online locations

        1. Register an online location using the [Create a location](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-location) endpoint, setting the `type` to `online`.
        1. Configure your custom processes on your backend for each registered location (e.g., grouping orders, custom pricing, etc.).
        1. Send the `location_id` parameter in the request body during [order creation](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-order) to assign the order to a specific location.

      ### Physical locations

        1. Register a physical location using the [Create a location](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-location) endpoint, setting the `type` to `physical`.
        1. In case of Revolut POS, our system handles order creation including `location_id` to associate the order with your location.

      ## Fast checkout for multiple storefronts

      Locations are particularly useful for tailoring the user experience on each of your online storefronts, especially when using features like [**Fast checkout**](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/online-payments/revolut-pay/fast-checkout).

      For example, if you operate two online stores with different shipping rules, you can register two separate `online` locations. By then using the `location_id` to [register a distinct address validation endpoint](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/register-address-validation-endpoint) for each one, your backend can apply the correct shipping logic and pricing for the specific storefront a customer is buying from.

        Creating orders is one of the basic operations of the Merchant API. Most of the other operations are related to creating orders. Furthermore, the payment methods merchants can use to take payments for their orders are also built on order creation.

        ### Pre-authorisation and incremental authorisation

        Orders can be created with `authorisation_type: pre_authorisation` to enable incremental authorisation. This allows you to increase the authorised amount after the initial authorisation.

        **Requirements:**
        - `capture_mode` must be set to `manual`
        - `authorisation_type` must be set to `pre_authorisation`
        - Only supported for card payments currently

        **Example use cases:**
        - Hotels: authorise deposit, then increment for room service and minibar
        - Car rentals: authorise deposit, then increment for damages or fuel

      summary: Increment authorisation
      operationId: incrementOrderAuthorisation
      description: |-
        Increase the authorised amount on a pre-authorised order.

        This operation allows you to increment the authorised amount for orders created with `authorisation_type: pre_authorisation` and `capture_mode: manual`.

        :::note
        Currently, only card payments are supported.
        :::

        ### Common use-cases

        - Hotel additional charges (e.g., minibar, room service)
        - Car rental damage or fuel charges
        - Equipment rental extensions

        ### How it works

        1. Create an order with `capture_mode: manual` and `authorisation_type: pre_authorisation`
        1. Take payment using one of our card payment solutions
        1. When payment/order reaches `authorised` state, you can increment authorised amount
        1. When no more increments are expected, [capture the order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/2025-10-16/capture-order) to complete the transaction

        :::caution
        - Can only increment orders in `authorised` state
        - Must have `authorisation_type: pre_authorisation` and `capture_mode: manual`
        - Sum of all increment amounts cannot exceed 5x the initial amount
        - Maximum 10 increments per order
        - Process increments sequentially to avoid declines
        - Currently only supported for card payments

      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to capture the funds of an existing, uncaptured order. When the payment for an order is authorised, you can capture the order to send it to the processing stage.

        :::info
        For more information about the order and payment lifecycle, see: [Order and payment
        lifecycle](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/other-resources/order-payment-flow).
        :::

        ## Capture modes

        When you [create an order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-order), you can choose one of the following capture modes:

          | **Capture mode** | **Description** |
          | ---------------- | --------------- |
          | `automatic` | The order is captured automatically after payment authorisation. No further actions are needed. |
          | `manual` | The order is not captured automatically and stays in `authorised` state. You must manually capture the order using the steps outlined below. |

        :::caution
        Uncaptured orders remain in `authorised` state **for 7 days**. If not captured within this period, the funds are returned to the customer's original payment method.
        :::

        ### Manual capture
          
        To capture an order manually, use one of the following methods:
          
        | **Web UI** | **Merchant API** |
        | ---------- | ------------ |
        | <ol><li>Log in to your [Revolut Business portal](https://business.revolut.com).</li><li>Navigate to the **Merchant** tab on the dashboard, and click the **See all** button in the **Transactions** section.</li><li>Select an uncaptured payment, and click **Capture**.</li></ol> | Use the `/capture` endpoint. |

        :::info
        For more information about manually capturing an order, see: [Authorise an amount to capture
        later](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/capture-later).
        :::

        #### Partial capture
         
        You have the option to capture only a fraction of the full amount. In such cases, the uncaptured portion of the amount will be voided.

        :::caution
        The following limitations apply to manual captures:
          - It's not possible to capture an amount multiple times
          - Captured amount can't exceed the authorised amount
          - On Web UI, only capturing full amount is possible
          - `0` amount captures are not allowed
          - For partial captures, you can only resend the request with the initial amount
        :::

        ## Idempotency and repeated requests

        The capture operation is idempotent. This means that an order can only be captured once. If you send a capture request more than once:

        - The first valid request captures the order and moves it to the processing stage.
        - Any subsequent capture requests for the same order will not recapture the funds. Instead, these requests will behave like a [Retrieve an order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/retrieve-order) request. The response will provide the current state of the order as if you queried it using the order retrieval endpoint.

        :::info
        Utilising the idempotent nature of this endpoint helps maintain data consistency and prevents duplicate processing of the same order.

        Issue a refund for a completed order. This operation allows for either a full or partial refund, which will be processed back to the customer's original payment method.

        - The refund operation generates a new order with `type: refund`. This new order represents a full or partial refund of the original amount paid.
        - Multiple partial refunds can be issued for a single order, given the total refunded amount does not exceed the original order amount.
        - Refund orders will contain `related_order_id` which links to the original order that was refunded.
        - Refunds can only be initiated for orders that are in a `completed` state. Orders in any other state are not eligible for refunds to ensure transaction integrity and to prevent errors.

        :::note
        Consider using the `Idempotency-Key` header to make the refund operation idempotent, preventing duplicate refund processing in cases of multiple submissions.

        :::note
        The `/orders/{order_id}/confirm` endpoint has been deprecated. It will be only supported for already existing implementations.
        :::

        :::caution
        This endpoint is part of a new API, pay attention to the different endpoint URL. 
        :::

        For more information about how to save and charge payment methods, see: [Charge a customer's saved payment method](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/save-and-charge-payment-methods/charge-saved-payment-method).

        The following table shows who can initiate payments on saved payment methods (`initiator` parameter), depending on if the payment method was saved for the customer or the merchant (`savedPaymentMethodFor` parameter):

          |                           | `savePaymentMethodFor: customer` | `savePaymentMethodFor: merchant` |
          | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
          | **`initiator: customer`** | Allowed                          | Allowed                          |
          | **`initiator: merchant`** | Not allowed                      | Allowed                          |


        :::note
        Using this endpoint, only merchant initiated payments are supported with Revolut Pay.

      summary: Create a subscription plan
      operationId: createSubscriptionPlan
      description: |-
        Create a new subscription plan with one or more pricing variations.

        A subscription plan defines the billing structure for subscriptions. Each plan can have multiple variations (e.g., monthly vs. yearly), and each variation can have multiple billing phases (e.g., trial period followed by regular billing).

        ## How subscription plans work

        A subscription plan consists of three hierarchical levels:

        1. **Plan**: The top-level container with a name (e.g., "Pro Plan", "Enterprise Plan")
        1. **Variations**: Different pricing options within the same plan (e.g., monthly vs. yearly)
        1. **Phases**: Sequential billing stages within each variation

        ### Understanding phases

        Phases execute in sequence based on their `ordinal` value (1, 2, 3, etc.):
        - Each phase has a `cycle_duration` (e.g., `P1M` for monthly)
        - Each phase has a `cycle_count` that determines how many cycles before moving to the next phase
        - If `cycle_count` is `null` or omitted, the phase continues indefinitely
        - When a phase completes its cycles, the subscription moves to the phase with the next `ordinal`
        - If the last phase completes its cycles and no next phase exists, the subscription is automatically stopped

        :::note
        If a `trial_duration` is defined, phases begin immediately after the trial ends.
        :::

        :::tip Example
        A plan with a 7-day trial followed by monthly billing:

        Set `trial_duration: "P7D"` at the plan level. Then define a variation with a single phase that has `ordinal: 1`, `cycle_duration: "P1M"`, and `amount: 9900`.

        After the 7-day trial ends, phase 1 begins automatically and charges monthly indefinitely (since `cycle_count` is not specified).

        Create a new subscription for a customer using a subscription plan variation.

        There are several supported flows for creating and activating subscriptions, depending on your integration needs.

        :::note
        The customer must already exist in the API. The `customer_id` is required for all subscription flows.
        :::

        <details>
        <summary>

        #### Flow 1: Hosted Payment Page (HPP)

        </summary>

        Use this flow to redirect the customer to Revolut's Hosted Payment Page to complete the first payment and save their payment method.

        **Backend flow:**
        1. Create a subscription with optional `setup_order_redirect_url`:
           - If provided: The setup order's `redirect_url` field will be set to this value.
           - If omitted: The setup order will use Revolut's default redirect behavior.
        1. The subscription is created in a `pending` state with a `setup_order_id` in the response.
        1. [Retrieve the order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/retrieve-order) using `setup_order_id` as the `order_id` in the path to get the `checkout_url`.
        1. Redirect the customer to the `checkout_url` for the Hosted Payment Page.

        **Customer flow:**
        1. Customer is redirected to Revolut's Hosted Payment Page.
        1. Customer completes payment on the HPP, and their payment method is saved.
        1. Customer redirect after payment depends on your setup:
           - **With `setup_order_redirect_url`**: Customer is redirected to your custom URL.
           - **Without `setup_order_redirect_url`**: Customer sees the default Revolut completion screen.

        **Key characteristics:**
        - Customer completes payment on Revolut's hosted page
        - Payment method is automatically saved for future billing cycles
        - Optional custom redirect after payment
        - Best for web-based integrations

        </details>

        <details>

        <summary>

        #### Flow 2: Widget or card-not-present (CNP) payment

        </summary>

        Use this flow when you want to embed the payment experience directly on your website using one of Revolut's payment widgets or handle card-not-present payments.

        **Backend flow:**
        1. Create a subscription with minimal required parameters.
        1. The subscription is created in a `pending` state with a `setup_order_id` in the response.
        1. [Retrieve the order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/retrieve-order) using `setup_order_id` as the `order_id` in the path to get order details for your integration.
        1. Integrate your payment solution (widget, SDK, or CNP method) on your frontend, ensuring it's configured to save the customer's payment method for recurring billing.

        **Customer flow:**
        1. Customer stays on your website/application.
        1. Customer completes payment, and their payment method is saved for future billing cycles.

        **Key characteristics:**
        - Payment experience embedded directly in your application
        - Customer never leaves your website
        - Payment method is saved for future billing cycles
        - Best for native mobile apps or fully custom web experiences

        Update a subscription's details.

        You can update a subscription and specific parameters based on the value of the `state` parameter:

        | State parameter value | Modifiable parameters |
        | --------------------- | --------------------- |
        | `pending`, `active`, `overdue`, `paused` | You can modify all listed parameters. |
        | `cancelled`, `finished` | You cannot modify parameters. These are final states. |

        **Common use cases:**
        - **Update external reference**: When you need to sync with updated customer records in your system, correct an initial reference value, or re-map the subscription to a different internal tracking ID to maintain consistency with your database.

      summary: Register address validation endpoint for Fast checkout
      operationId: registerAddressValidationEndpoint
      description: |-
        Use this endpoint to register a URL where Revolut can send shipping address(es) from a Revolut Pay customer for validation during the [Fast checkout
        process](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/online-payments/revolut-pay/fast-checkout).

        Revolut Pay can support Fast checkout for delivering goods. Once your customer selects a shipping address, Revolut needs to validate if the merchant (or their shipping partner) delivers to the address provided. This is done by contacting the merchant's backend and asking for such validation and information.

        In order for your backend to support Fast checkout, you need to:

        1. Register an URL to handle address validation
        1. Validate the shipping address sent to your backend
        1. Respond with a JSON object containing the result of the validation

        Additionally, Revolut Pay can support multiple webhooks if you have multiple stores. For more information, see:
          - [Manage multiple stores with Fast checkout](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/online-payments/revolut-pay/fast-checkout#manage-multiple-stores-with-fast-checkout)
          - [Merchant API: Locations](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/locations)

        The `Idempotency-Key` ensures that requests are processed only once, preventing multiple executions of the same operation due to retries or duplicate requests.

        This header is optional and can accept any unique string value the merchant uses.

        A recommended practice is to use a unique identifier from your system (such as the entity's ID or a request UUID) as the idempotency key. This facilitates tracking and managing requests effectively.

        To paginate through results:

          1. Make an initial request with the desired `limit`.
          1. The response will include a `next_page_token` if more results are available.
          1. Use that token in the `page_token` parameter of your next request.
          1. Repeat until `next_page_token` is not present.

        :::note
        When using `page_token`, you must include all query parameters from the initial request (such as `from`, `to`, or other filter parameters) to maintain consistent filtering across pages.

        You can set a dynamic statement descriptor for your orders by providing a custom suffix. 

        A statement descriptor is the text shown on cardholders' bank or card statements, helping them recognise a transaction or merchant. This field can be used to send extra information with the statement descriptor for card transactions.

        The complete descriptor is built using the following format: `{base}*{suffix}`, where:
          
          - **`{base}`** is the existing descriptor configured in the Revolut Business dashboard (**Settings > Business account > Merchant profile > Statement descriptor**).  
          - **`{suffix}`** is defined by the `statement_descriptor_suffix` field.

        :::note
        - If the combined descriptor's length (base + suffix) exceeds the character limits of card scheme providers, the final value will be truncated. For example if the limit is 22 characters, the base descriptor is `"base"` and the suffix is `"testdescriptorsuffix"`, the final descriptor becomes `"base*testdescriptorsuf"`.
        - The final statement descriptor shown on a cardholder's statement may vary by issuing bank, as some banks apply their own custom formatting or truncation rules.

        #### Fingerprint generation

        | Payment method | Description |
        | -------- | ----------- |
        | **All payment methods** | A fingerprint is generated for all payment methods, including cards, Revolut Pay (card, account-to-account payments), Apple Pay, and Google Pay. |
        | **Cards (Revolut Pay & Card Gateway)** | For cards, the fingerprint is based on the PAN. Cards processed via Revolut Pay and our card gateway will share the same fingerprint. Renewed cards (new expiry/CVV) retain the same fingerprint for efficient blocking. |
        | **Apple Pay & Google Pay** | Since Apple Pay and Google Pay provide us Device PANs (DPAN), the fingerprint is based on the DPAN provided by Apple/Google, not the connected card's PAN. This means that a new DPAN (and fingerprint) is generated for cards in case they are re-added to the customer's digital wallet, or added to different devices. |

        #### Detecting duplicate payment methods

        Fingerprints are a valuable tool for detecting duplicate payment methods by identifying if a payment method has been seen before. This capability, in turn, helps in preventing various types of misuse (e.g., exploitation of free trials, or association with known problematic accounts, which can be a form of fraud). To effectively use fingerprints for this purpose, you will need to create and maintain your own lists (e.g., blocklists of known problematic fingerprints, allowlists for trusted customers, or tracking frequently used fingerprints). 

        The ideal way to utilise fingerprints is by combining them with a manual capture process. While automatic capture with subsequent refunds for problematic payments is possible, manual capture based on fingerprint validation is recommended.

        During your manual capture workflow, after a payment was authorised:
          
          - Check the fingerprint status by comparing it against your maintained lists and internal business rules.
          - If you decide to proceed with the payment (e.g., the fingerprint is not on a blocklist, or matches a trusted customer's previous payment method): [Capture the order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/capture-order).
          - If you decide not to proceed with the payment (e.g., the fingerprint matches a known fraudulent fingerprint, or exhibits suspicious patterns): [Cancel the order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/cancel-order).

        The sequential order of this phase in the subscription billing lifecycle.

        Phases execute in ascending order based on this value:
        - Phase with `ordinal=1` executes first
        - Phase with `ordinal=2` executes second, and so on

        When a phase completes its `cycle_count`, the subscription automatically progresses to the phase with the next `ordinal` value.

        **Example**: A subscription with phases ordered as `ordinal=1` (trial), `ordinal=2` (regular), `ordinal=3` (discounted) will progress through them in that sequence.

        The length of each billing cycle for this phase in [ISO 8601 duration format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

        This determines how often the customer is billed during this phase. The total time spent in a phase is `cycle_duration × cycle_count`.

        **Common durations**:

        | Duration | Description |
        | -------- | ----------- |
        | `P1M` | 1 month |
        | `P1Y` | 1 year |
        | `P15D` | 15 days |
        | `P1W` | 1 week |
        | `PT2H` | 2 hours |

        **Example**: If `cycle_duration=P1M` and `cycle_count=12`, the customer will be billed monthly for 12 months (1 year total).
    Cycle-Count:
      type: integer
      nullable: true
      minimum: 1
      description: |-
        Number of billing cycles for this phase before moving to the next phase.

        | Value | Behavior |
        | ----- | -------- |
        | `null` or omitted | Phase continues indefinitely. The subscription remains in this phase with no automatic progression. |
        | Specific number (e.g., `1`, `3`, `12`) | After completing this many billing cycles, the subscription automatically moves to the next phase as determined by the `ordinal` field. |

        **Example**: If `cycle_count=3` and `cycle_duration=P1M`, the subscription will complete 3 monthly cycles then move to the phase with the next highest `ordinal` value.

        :::note
        If no next phase exists in after a cycle with a specific `cycle_count`, the subscription will automatically stop when it completes its cycles.

        For example, `9900` in `GBP` represents £99.00.

        :::info
        Conversion between major and minor units varies by currency. For instance, `100` minor units equal £1.00 in `GBP`, whereas in `ISK` they represent 100 units. For more details, see the [ISO 4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

        ### Override plan defaults

        Subscription plans can define a default trial duration. When creating a subscription, you can use this field to override the plan's default trial period:

        | Field value | Behaviour | Example |
        | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
        | **Not provided** | Uses the trial duration defined in the plan (if any) | Plan has `"P7D"` → subscription gets 7-day trial |
        | **Different value** | Overrides the plan's default trial duration | Plan has `"P7D"` → set to `"P30D"` for promotional offer, or `"P3D"` to reduce |
        | **`"P0D"`** | Explicitly skips the trial period | Plan has `"P7D"` → set to `"P0D"` to skip trial entirely |

        :::note
        Only days (`D`) are allowed. Time components such as hours, minutes, or seconds are not permitted.
        :::
      example: P14D
      pattern: ^P[0-9]+D$
    Subscription-Trial-End-Date:
      type: string

      description: |-
        The date and time when the subscription's trial period ends in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

        This value is automatically calculated by the system as: `start_date` + `trial_duration`

        The `trial_duration` used in the calculation comes from either:
        - The subscription's custom `trial_duration` (if provided at creation time), or
        - The plan's default `trial_duration` (if no override was specified)

        This field is `null` when the subscription has no trial period (e.g., when `trial_duration` is not set or is `"P0D"`).

    Webhook:
      title: Webhook
      type: object
      description: |-
        A `webhook` (also called a web callback) allows your system to receive an event from a different app immediately after it happens. 

        For example, you can subscribe to a webhook when an order changes from Pending to Completed. When the payment is cleared and the order is completed, Revolut servers will send a notification to the URL of your choice. This is a much more efficient way to know when an order is paid as opposed to trying to get the status of the order every few seconds.

        Many events that happen to a Revolut Merchant account are synchronous, which means that they arrive instantly and have immediate results. For example, a successful request to create a customer immediately returns a Customer object. Such requests don't require webhooks.

        The Revolut Merchant API supports webhooks for events such as `ORDER_COMPLETED` and `ORDER_AUTHORISED`.
