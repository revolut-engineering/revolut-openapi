    The Revolut Open Banking API is the gateway for third-party providers to interact with Revolut customers and products.

    You can take advantage of the Open Banking API to build your banking applications whether you are:  
    - A regulated third party provider that wants to get account and transaction information of Revolut customers and initiate different types of payments, or 
    - An innovative service provider that is looking to seamlessly integrate Revolut functions into your own applications.

    As such, you can use the Open Banking API to leverage the following features: 
    - [Account management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/accounts)
    - [Transaction management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/transactions)
    - Payment management:
      - Domestic: [Domestic payments](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/domestic-payment), [Domestic scheduled payments](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/domestic-scheduled-payment), [Domestic standing orders](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/domestic-standing-order)
      - International: [International payments](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/international-payment), [International scheduled payments](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/international-scheduled-payment), [International standing orders](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/international-standing-order)
      - Other: [Draft payments](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/draft-payment), [File payments](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/file-payment)
    - [Application management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/open-banking/applications)

    # Authentication

    <SecurityDefinitions />

    ## Get Access token

    ### Certificates

    You must use a transport certificate and its private key in order to request an access token.

    - For Sandbox testing, you can use the `transport.pem` certificate file which you obtained in [Convert certificates](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/get-started/prepare-sandbox-environment#convert-certificates) together with the private key generated in step [Generate a CSR](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/get-started/prepare-sandbox-environment#generate-a-csr).

    - For Production, you will need to use a valid OBIE or eIDAS transport certificate from a regulated Certificate Authority, and its corresponding private key.

    :::note
    Revolut Open Banking API servers use certificates issued by Open Banking Limited.

    You can find the root and issuing certificates [here](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/23494678/Certificates+and+Software+Statements) if you need to add them to your truststore.
    :::

    ### Headers

    - `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

    ### Parameters

    - `grant_type`: Must be set to `client_credentials` to get the access token.
    - `scope`: Must be set to `accounts`.

    ### Example

    :::note
    The parameters `-k` or `--insecure` are not necessary if you added Open Banking Root and Issuing certificates to your truststore.

        Create a domestic payment consent described in the [Open Banking API documentation: Account and Transaction API Specification](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/999622968/Account+and+Transaction+API+Specification+-+v3.1.1).

        Use domestic payments for local payments in the local currency of the user.

        :::note
        Revolut supports only GBP as local in the UK and EUR in Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) countries.
        :::

        Because Revolut Business users can have multiple accounts in the same currency, they can choose which account they want to be charged in the consent authorization UI.

        When you make the API call, ensure that you pass the corresponding JSON Web Signature (JWS) in the `x-jws-signature` request header. Note:
        - The JWS is generated from the request body with the [TPP](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/glossary) signing key that is specified in the JWS header.
        - The JWS consists of a header and a signature in the `<jws_header>..<jws_signature>` format.

        To see how to create a JWS, see the guide: [Work with JSON Web Signatures](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/work-with-json-web-signatures).

        Create a scheduled payment consent as described in the [Open Banking API documentation: Account and Transaction API Specification](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/999622968/Account+and+Transaction+API+Specification+-+v3.1.1).

        Use domestic scheduled payments for local scheduled payments in the local currency of the user.

        :::note
        Revolut supports only GBP as local in the UK and EUR in SEPA countries.
        :::

        Because Revolut Business users can have multiple accounts in the same currency, they can select which account they want to be charged in the consent authorization UI.

        When you make the API call, ensure that you pass the corresponding JSON Web Signature (JWS) in the `x-jws-signature` request header. Note:
        - The JWS is generated from the request body with the [TPP](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/glossary) signing key that is specified in the JWS header.
        - The JWS consists of a header and a signature in the `<jws_header>..<jws_signature>` format.

        To see how to create a JWS, see the guide: [Work with JSON Web Signatures](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/work-with-json-web-signatures).

        :::note
        The domestic scheduled payments API is in beta.

        Create a domestic standing order consent described in the [Open Banking API documentation: Account and Transaction API Specification](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/999622968/Account+and+Transaction+API+Specification+-+v3.1.1).

        Use domestic standing orders for local recurring payments in the local currency of the user.

        :::note
        Revolut supports only GBP as local in the UK and EUR in Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) countries.
        :::

        Because Revolut Business users can have multiple accounts in the same currency, they can choose which account they want to be charged in the consent authorization UI.

        When you make the API call, ensure that you pass the corresponding JSON Web Signature (JWS) in the `x-jws-signature` request header. Note:
        - The JWS is generated from the request body with the [TPP](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/glossary) signing key that is specified in the JWS header.
        - The JWS consists of a header and a signature in the `<jws_header>..<jws_signature>` format.

        To see how to create a JWS, see the guide: [Work with JSON Web Signatures](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/work-with-json-web-signatures).


        The following types of standing orders frequency are supported:

        |  FREQUENCY |  EXAMPLE | DETAILS  |
        |---|---|---|
        |  `EvryDay` | EvryDay  | daily, supported only for personal accounts  |
        | `IntrvlWkDay`  | IntrvlWkDay:01:03  | weekly on a specified week day, only 1 week interval is supported  |
        | `IntrvlMnthDay`  | IntrvlMnthDay:01:03  |  monthly on a specified day of month, only 1 month interval is supported |

        :::note
        File Payments are available only for Revolut Business users.
        Currently only the `text/csv` file type is supported for File Payments.
        :::

        When you make the API call, ensure that you pass the corresponding JSON Web Signature (JWS) in the `x-jws-signature` request header. Note:
        - The JWS is generated from the request body with the [TPP](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/glossary) signing key that is specified in the JWS header.
        - The JWS consists of a header and a signature in the `<jws_header>..<jws_signature>` format.

        To see how to create a JWS, see the guide: [Work with JSON Web Signatures](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/work-with-json-web-signatures).

        Use international payments for international SWIFT payments in all currencies supported by Revolut.

        :::note
        Only the payments with `InstructedAmount` in the same currency as `CurrencyOfTransfer` are supported.

        However, users can select which account they want to be charged in the consent authorization UI even if the selected account is in a different currency.

        In such a case, the `ExchangeRateInformation` response field contains information about the `ExchangeRate` between `SourceCurrency` and `CurrencyOfTransfer`.
        If the user doesn't have enough funds on the selected account, the consent authorization is rejected.
        :::

        :::note
        For international payment initiation consents, we recommend including the creditor's name and address.  
        Otherwise, the API may return the error `Address is required for this beneficiary` if the address is not provided for international payments.
        :::

        When you make the API call, ensure that you pass the corresponding JSON Web Signature (JWS) in the `x-jws-signature` request header. Note:
        - The JWS is generated from the request body with the [TPP](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/glossary) signing key that is specified in the JWS header.
        - The JWS consists of a header and a signature in the `<jws_header>..<jws_signature>` format.

        To see how to create a JWS, see the guide: [Work with JSON Web Signatures](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/work-with-json-web-signatures).

        Create an international scheduled payment consent described in the [Open Banking API documentation: Account and Transaction API Specification](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/999622968/Account+and+Transaction+API+Specification+-+v3.1.1).

        Use international scheduled payments for international SWIFT payments in all currencies supported by Revolut.

        :::note
        Only the payments with `InstructedAmount` in the same currency as `CurrencyOfTransfer` are supported.
        :::

        However, users can select which account they want to be charged in the consent authorization UI even if the selected account is in a different currency.

        In such a case, the `ExchangeRateInformation` response field contains information about the `ExchangeRate` between `SourceCurrency` and `CurrencyOfTransfer`.
        If the user doesn't have enough funds on the selected account, the consent authorization is rejected.

        When you make the API call, ensure that you pass the corresponding JSON Web Signature (JWS) in the `x-jws-signature` request header. Note:
        - The JWS is generated from the request body with the [TPP](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/glossary) signing key that is specified in the JWS header.
        - The JWS consists of a header and a signature in the `<jws_header>..<jws_signature>` format.

        To see how to create a JWS, see the guide: [Work with JSON Web Signatures](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/work-with-json-web-signatures).

        Creating an international standing order consent described in the [Open Banking API documentation: Account and Transaction API Specification](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/999622968/Account+and+Transaction+API+Specification+-+v3.1.1).

        Use international standing orders for international SWIFT payments in all currencies supported by Revolut.

        :::note
        Only the payments with `InstructedAmount` in the same currency as `CurrencyOfTransfer` are supported.
        :::

        However, users can select which account they want to be charged in the consent authorization UI even if the selected account is in a different currency.

        In such a case, the `ExchangeRateInformation` response field contains information about the `ExchangeRate` between `SourceCurrency` and `CurrencyOfTransfer`.
        If the user doesn't have enough funds on the selected account, the consent authorization is rejected.

        When you make the API call, ensure that you pass the corresponding JSON Web Signature (JWS) in the `x-jws-signature` request header. Note:
        - The JWS is generated from the request body with the [TPP](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/glossary) signing key that is specified in the JWS header.
        - The JWS consists of a header and a signature in the `<jws_header>..<jws_signature>` format.

        To see how to create a JWS, see the guide: [Work with JSON Web Signatures](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/work-with-json-web-signatures).

        :::note
        Only the following types of standing orders frequency are supported:

        |  FREQUENCY |  EXAMPLE | DETAILS  |
        |---|---|---|
        |  `EvryDay` | `EvryDay`  | daily, supported only for personal accounts  |
        | `IntrvlWkDay`  | `IntrvlWkDay:01:03`  | weekly on a specified week day, only 1 week interval is supported  |
        | `IntrvlMnthDay`  | `IntrvlMnthDay:01:03`  |  monthly on a specified day of month, only 1 month interval is supported |

        Before you begin, ensure that you've got an access token.
        For information about getting the access token, see [Tutorial: Create your first draft payment](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/build-banking-apps/tutorials/create-your-first-draft-payment).
        Then, you can use the `/draft_payments` endpoint to create a draft payment on behalf of a user, and the draft payment appears in the user account where they can approve or reject.

        In addition, you can use this endpoint to make multiple draft payments by creating new rows for new drafts with the supported CSV format shown in the following tables.

        For each draft payment request you make, ensure that the same currency is used.
        Upon a successful request for multiple draft payments, you receive a `DraftPaymentID` that represents all the draft payments associated with this request.

        Please note that the maximum number of rows in a CSV file is 50 and all the payments must be in the same currency.

        :::note
        Download an [example CSV file](https://assets.revolut.com/api-docs/oba-api/draft_payments.csv).
        :::

        For the format of the CSV file, check the request body details.

        Each Open Banking API must contain an authorization header in the following format to make a call: `Bearer <yourAccessToken>`.

        Before you start, ensure that you've got an access token with the correct `scope` using the `/token` endpoint.
        You need to get the authorization code first and exchange it for an access token.

        :::danger
        Never share your `access_token` with anyone, as it can be used to access the banking data that you have access to and initiate transactions.
