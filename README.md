# Revolut OpenAPI specifications

Revolut provides various APIs to help you integrate financial services, accept payments, manage accounts, and much more. You can explore our full API documentation and capabilities on our [Developer Portal](https://developer.revolut.com/).

This repository contains Revolut API definition files, represented in the OpenAPI Specification standard. These definitions provide a machine-readable description of our APIs, facilitating integration and tooling.

## Folder structure

The specifications in this repository are organised in two sub-folders:

```
  /json - Specifications in JSON format.
  /yaml - Specifications in YAML format.
```

## Usage

There are multiple ways you can use these specifications to explore and work with Revolut APIs:

- **Explore with our documentation:** Visit the [Revolut Developer Portal](https://developer.revolut.com/) to see the API specifications rendered into interactive documentation.
- **Use classic Swagger tools:** Upload these specifications to the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/) for online viewing, and code generation.
- **Import into API clients:** If you prefer to use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), you can fork our collections from our [public Postman workspace here](https://www.postman.com/revolut-api/revolut-developers/overview), or import these API definitions and create your personal collections of requests for testing and development.
- **Generate client SDKs:** Use OpenAPI code generation tools (e.g., [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)) to automatically create client libraries in your preferred programming language.
